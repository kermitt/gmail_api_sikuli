Some notes:<p>

For gmail api you will need to create a client-secret.json in the src/main/resources.<br>
See https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/java for "Step 1: Turn on the Gmail API"<br>
<hr>

Setting up for Sikuli IDE is a little different than normal:<br>
I used<br>
<ul>
<li>sikulisetup-1.1.1.jar</li>
<li>sikulixapi.jar</li>
</ul>
Run the setup jar and that will launch a wizard and walk you through some choices.

<hr>
Take script from SikuliScript.logic and put that ( or something like it ) into your Sikuli IDE
